# Robotic Assisted Greeting System
Matthew O'Hara




<b>Project Description</b>

The Cozmo robot will be demonstrating how a robot can greet a user and help them chose and put on an outfit. 

 

The Cozmo robot will be using facial recognision to recognise a pre scanned face. Each face will have a city and name associated. Cozmo will then use this information to create a greeting message - The Greeting message will contain the name date and weather outside. The robot will then ask if the user wants Cozmo to collect their chosen outfit  

 

The outfit is represented by cozmo’s cubes and represents either your jacket, shorts or shorts and sunglasses- This changes depending on the temperature outside.  

 

After verification from the user the robot will go and collect the cubes(“outfit”) and bring them to the user, with a confirmation message.
